# CITS4407 - Assignment 2: Board Games Analysis

Author: Xuechen Mao

---

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing board games from BoardGameGeek dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/board-games. The original data is semicolon-separated and includes inconsistencies such as missing values, non-ASCII characters, and formatting issues.

Three shell scripts are provided:

- `empty_cells`: Checks and reports the number of empty cells per column.
- `preprocess`: Cleans the dataset and standard output.
- `analysis`: Analyzes the cleaned file and output answers four research questions.

# Scripts Description

## 1. empty_cells

Purpose:  
Detect and report the number of empty (missing) values in each column of a dataset.

Usage:  
```bash
./empty_cells <file> <separator>
```

Features:
- Accepts any separator (e.g.',' ';' )
- Uses awk to count missing fields per column
- Outputs the column name and its corresponding empty cell count

Example Output:
/ID: 0
Name: 0
Year Published: 0
Min Players: 0
Max Players: 0
Play Time: 0
Min Age: 0
Users Rated: 0
Rating Average: 0
BGG Rank: 0
Complexity Average: 0
Owned Users: 0
Mechanics: 0
Domains: 0

---

## 2. preprocess

Purpose:  
Clean and standardize the raw .txt dataset and convert it into a .tsv (tab-separated) format ready for analysis.

Usage:  
```bash
./preprocess <input_file>
```
If you want to transform to .tsv format: 
```bash
./preprocess <input_file> > <cleaned_tsv_file.tsv>
```

Features:
- Converts semicolons (;) to tab characters (\t)
- Converts Windows line endings (\r\n) to Unix (\n)
- Removes non-ASCII characters
- Converts numeric values using commas (,) to standard decimal dots (.)
- Replaces empty or invalid IDs with new unique integers

Example Output: 
```
/ID     Name    Year Published  Min Players     Max Players     Play Time       Min Age Users Rated     Rating Average  BGG Rank  Complexity Average       Owned Users     Mechanics       Domains

...

## 3. analysis

Purpose:  
Analyze a cleaned .tsv file to extract insights about board games.

Usage:  
```bash
./analysis <cleaned_file.tsv>
```

Features:
- Identifies the most frequent game mechanic and game domain
- Calculates the Pearson correlation between:
  1. Year Published and Average Rating
  2. Game Complexity and Average Rating
- Handles missing and malformed data gracefully
- Reports when insufficient data prevents correlation analysis

Example Output:
```
The most popular game mechanics is Hand Management found in 48 games  
The most popular game domain is Strategy Games found in 77 games  
The correlation between the year of publication and the average rating is 0.226  
The correlation between the complexity of a game and its average rating is 0.426
```

If data is insufficient:
```
The data should be at least 2, otherwise cannot compute correlation. 
```

If the correlation is meaningless: 
```
Not enough variation to compute correlation
```

# Research Questions Addressed

1. Game Mechanics Popularity  
   Which mechanics appear most frequently across all games?

2. Game Domain Popularity  
   Which game domains are most common?

3. Temporal Analysis  
   Is there a correlation between the year of publication and game rating?

4. Complexity Analysis  
   Is game complexity related to how highly a game is rated?

# Requirements

- A Unix/Linux environment (course Docker image or UniApps recommended)
- Shell utilities: awk, tr, grep, sort, cut, etc.
- All scripts are written in Bash

---

# Notes and Assumptions

- Column order in the dataset is fixed and consistent
- Input to analysis must be a cleaned .tsv file generated by preprocess
- Scripts produce only final output, no intermediate temp files
- Errors are printed to stderr
- Scripts include basic input validation
